            Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers.
            
            The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.<sup>[158]</sup>
            
            Tesla Energy's generation products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Other products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Powerpack and Megapack, which are large-scale energy storage systems.<sup>[159][160][161]</sup> Tesla Energy also develops software to allow customers to monitor and control their systems.<sup>[162][163]</sup>
            
            In 2021, the company deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 345 megawatts, an increase of 68% over 2020,<sup>[164]</sup> and deployed 3.99 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 32% over 2020.<sup>[165]</sup>

            Tesla Roadster prototype
            In a surprise reveal at the end of the event that introduced the Tesla Semi on November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster. Musk said that the new model will have a range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with the 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack and will achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; it also will achieve 0–100 miles per hour (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,<sup>[126]</sup> and the top speed will be over 250 miles per hour (400 km/h). The SpaceX Package will include cold air thrusters that will increase the speed even more.<sup>[127]</sup> The vehicle will have three electric motors allowing for all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.<sup>[127]</sup>
            
            At the time, the base price was set at $200,000, while the first 1,000 units (the Founder's series) will sell for $250,000.<sup>[127] </sup>Reservations required a deposit of $50,000, and those who ordered the Founder's series paid the $250,000 in full upon ordering. Those who made a reservation at the event were allowed a test drive (with a driver) in the prototype.<sup>[128]</sup> Deliveries are expected to start in 2022.<sup>[129]</sup>
